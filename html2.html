				Banksia serrata, the old man banksia, is a species of woody shrub or tree in the+ family Proteaceae.
			<q> It is found from Queensland to Victoria, commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16 m (50 ft) in height, though it can be much smaller in more exposed areas. It has wrinkled grey bark and 	hiny dark green serrated leaves.</q> 
			The large yellow or greyish-yellow flower spikes turn grey as they age, and pollinated flowers develop into large, grey, woody seed pods. 
			This Banksia species is one of four collected by Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of four published in 1782 as part of Carl Linnaeus the Younger's original description of the genus. 
			Throughout its range, it grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant where it grows in scrubland or low woodland. B. serrata is pollinated by and provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. It is a common plant of parks and gardens.

			 	<pre>
			 		
			 		By day the bat is cousin to the mouse.
					He likes the attic of an aging house.

					His fingers make a hat about his head.
					His pulse beat is so slow we think him dead.

					He loops in crazy figures half the night	
					Among the trees that face the corner light.

					But when he brushes up against a screen,
					We are afraid of what our eyes have seen:

					For something is amiss or out of place
					When mice with wings can wear a human face.
